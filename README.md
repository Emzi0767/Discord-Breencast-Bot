## ABOUT

A Discord bot built on top of [disco library](https://github.com/b1naryth1ef/disco/). It was built to provide a 24/7 [Breencast](http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Breencast) in my guild.

## REQUIREMENTS

* Python 3.6 or newer
* PIP Packages:
   * `disco-py` 0.0.8
   * `requests` 2.13.0
   * `ujson` 1.35

## SETUP

In order for bot to run, you will need to set up your environment. It is recommended to use the `virtualenv` module to create a new virtual environment for the bot.

1. Create a directory for the bot.
2. Copy bot's files to the directory.
3. Copy `config.json` from `sample_configs` to bot's directory.
4. Edit `config.json` to match your configuration.

## RUNNING

Run `runcmb.sh`. That's it, your bot is now running.
